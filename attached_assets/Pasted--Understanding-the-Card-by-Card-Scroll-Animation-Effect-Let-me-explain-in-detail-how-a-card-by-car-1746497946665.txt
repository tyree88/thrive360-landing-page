# Understanding the Card-by-Card Scroll Animation Effect

Let me explain in detail how a card-by-card scroll animation would work for your Stats section, where each statistic appears one at a time as users scroll, creating a deck-of-cards effect.

## Conceptual Overview

The animation creates an experience where:

1. The entire Stats section pins to the viewport when the user scrolls to it
2. As the user continues scrolling, instead of the page moving, the content within the pinned section changes
3. Statistics appear one at a time, with each new stat replacing the previous one
4. When a new stat enters, the previous one moves out of view (typically upward)
5. This creates a deck-of-cards effect where each statistic gets dedicated focus

## Technical Mechanism

### Pinning and Scroll Control

The foundation of this animation is pinning a section to the viewport during scrolling. When a user reaches the Stats section, it "sticks" to the screen while the user continues to scroll. Instead of the page moving, the scroll action is translated into animation progress.

The scrolling distance required to complete all animations is artificially lengthened. For example, if you have 4 statistics, the scroll distance might be set to 400% of the viewport height, giving each statistic card approximately 100% viewport height of scrolling distance.

### Card Positioning

All statistic cards are positioned in the same physical space, stacked on top of each other. Initially, only the first card is visible, while the others are hidden (either with opacity set to 0 or positioned off-screen).

Each card has a specific z-index value to control its stacking order, ensuring that newer cards appear on top of older ones.

### Animation Sequence

As the user scrolls, a complex animation sequence unfolds:

1. **Initial State**: Only the first statistic card is visible.

2. **Scroll Begins**: 
   - As the user scrolls down, the section pins to the viewport.
   - The first card's content (number and text) animates in if it hasn't already.

3. **Transition to Second Card**:
   - At approximately 25% through the total scroll distance, the transition begins.
   - The first card animates away (typically moving upward, scaling slightly smaller, and reducing opacity).
   - Simultaneously, the second card animates in from below (or from wherever it was initially positioned).
   - Once visible, the second card's statistic number counts up from zero to its final value.
   - The description text for the second card fades in after the number animation.

4. **Subsequent Transitions**:
   - This pattern repeats for each statistic in the sequence.
   - Each card gets its moment to be the center of attention before transitioning out.
   - The process creates a sense of depth and dimensionality, as if the cards are stacked in 3D space.

5. **Final State**:
   - After all statistics have been displayed, the conclusion text fades in.
   - Once the user scrolls past the section, it unpins and regular scrolling resumes.

### 3D Enhancement

To enhance the visual effect, the cards can utilize subtle 3D transformations:

- A perspective value is applied to the container, creating a sense of depth.
- Cards tilt slightly as they enter and exit, enhancing the 3D illusion.
- When a card moves away, it might rotate along the X-axis (tilt backward) while scaling down.
- When a new card enters, it might rotate forward before settling into its final position.

These 3D effects create a more dimensional feel to the card transitions, making them appear to exist in physical space rather than just fading in and out.

## Interaction with Smooth Scrolling

Since your site uses Lenis for smooth scrolling, there needs to be integration between the scroll animation system and Lenis:

1. The animation system must wait for Lenis to be fully initialized before creating scroll-triggered animations.

2. Scroll position updates from Lenis need to be communicated to the animation system.

3. When a scroll-triggered animation pins a section, Lenis needs to be aware of this to adjust its own calculations.

4. The animation progress must update smoothly in response to Lenis's interpolated scroll position rather than the browser's native scroll position.

## Performance Considerations

To ensure the animation runs at 60fps even on mobile devices:

1. **Will-change Property**: The card elements use the CSS `will-change` property to hint to the browser that they'll be animated, allowing for GPU acceleration.

2. **Transform Properties**: Animations primarily use transform properties (translate, scale, rotate) and opacity, which can be hardware-accelerated.

3. **Batch DOM Operations**: When multiple elements need to be updated (like the counter animations), the changes are batched to minimize layout recalculations.

4. **Reduced Motion**: For users who prefer reduced motion, the animations can be simplified or disabled entirely.

5. **Progressive Enhancement**: The static version provides the content for users with JavaScript disabled or during initial loading, preventing layout shifts.

## User Experience Enhancement

The design creates several UX benefits:

1. **Focused Attention**: Each statistic gets exclusive focus, increasing its impact and memorability.

2. **Interactive Storytelling**: The user's scroll action directly controls the narrative pace, creating a sense of agency.

3. **Visual Interest**: The dimensional transitions maintain visual engagement throughout the statistics presentation.

4. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: By showing one statistic at a time rather than all at once, the cognitive load on the user is reduced.

5. **Scroll Progress Feedback**: Users intuitively understand how far they are through the content based on how many cards they've seen.

This animation technique creates a memorable, interactive experience that highlights important statistics while maintaining performance and accessibility. The deck-of-cards effect encourages users to engage with each data point individually before moving on to the next, reinforcing the impact of each statistic.
